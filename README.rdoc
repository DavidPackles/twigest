Twigest is a simple app built on rails that sends an email digest of notable twitter content from a user's feed at a frequency that they specify.

User authentication is provided via Devise's Twitter Oauth.

There are a handful of basic options:

* Which links or accounts to blacklist
* How frequently to receive digest
